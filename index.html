          <p class="mb-3">Welcome. My name is Alicia Alba, and I am pleased to announce that I am running for Alpine School Board in the upcoming election. Having long been involved in helping our Alpine School District become the best that it can be, my family and I have decided that the time has come for me to seek public office to represent the people of Pleasant Grove, Lindon, and American Fork.</p>
          <p class="mb-3">I grew up in Utah County. I attended BYU and taught elementary school in Alpine School District and Provo School District before moving to St. Louis, Missouri where I taught school for several more years. I hold a BS in Education from BYU and an MS of Education from Webster University. Our family moved back to Utah 14 years ago and has lived in the Lindon/Pleasant Grove/Cedar Hills area ever since. My husband, Jesse, and I currently reside in Lindon and have five children attending Alpine School District schools.</p>
          <p class="mb-3">I am very passionate about education. I have previously served in many capacities in our local PTA’s and School Community Councils over the past decade. I have also held leadership roles in various humanitarian and advocacy organizations here in Utah. I am committed to working tirelessly to meet the unique needs of every student in our stewardship, and I have experience working with legislators and other key leaders in actively advocating for the best possible future for Alpine School District.</p>
          <p class="mb-3">I love Alpine School District and want it to succeed in providing a quality educational experience for every student. Because of this love, I feel compelled to stand up and offer my best efforts to her future.</p>
          <p>I have demonstrated repeatedly that I am invested and committed to fostering greater transparency, communication, and collaboration between parents, teachers, and district leaders. I am an advocate at heart, and I pledge to sincerely listen and work diligently to serve you.</p>
          
          <!-- THANK YOU BOX -->
